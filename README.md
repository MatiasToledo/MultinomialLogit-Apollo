# Sustainable transport
MultinomialLogit application to model the decision of choice  transport alternatives in people from Concepci贸n, Chile.

For my undergraduate thesis I applied Discrete Choice Models: OrderedProbit using BIOGEME (https://biogeme.epfl.ch/) and MultinomialLogit with packages Apollo (R). 

We try to understand what factors influence people decision between traditional transport and sustainable transport in Concepci贸n, Chile.

The most interestings insights was:

- Concepci贸n doesn't have a sufficient road infrastructure for bicycles to be a viable transport alternative. 

- In Chile, by 2019 the automotive market continued to grow and, reviewing data from Concepci贸n, people are not preffers to carpooling: 46% of people travel alone in a car and the average car occupancy rate is 1.8.

- There is a strong economic dependence on the bus.

- People who recycle are more likely to use sustainable transport.

- Carpooling would only be used for short journeys.
